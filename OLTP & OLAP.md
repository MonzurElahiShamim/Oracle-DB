## OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)
- **Purpose**: Handles day-to-day transaction operations.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for systems that process large numbers of small, fast transactions, like **banking** or **e-commerce** systems.
- **Data Type**: Current, transactional data.
- **Operations**: Frequent, simple insert, update, delete operations.
- **Query Types**: Simple, short queries that focus on individual records (e.g., retrieve a customer order).
- **Normalization**: Highly normalized (many small tables to reduce redundancy and maintain integrity).
- **Performance**: Optimized for high throughput and minimal latency.
- **Users**: Used by front-end users, like customers and employees.
- **Example**: Banking systems, retail point-of-sale, ticket booking systems.

## OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)
- **Purpose**: Supports complex data analysis and decision-making processes.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for business intelligence, where historical data is analyzed to find trends, patterns, and insights.
- **Data Type**: Historical, aggregated, and summarized data.
- **Operations**: Complex queries, typically read-only, that scan large volumes of data.
- **Query Types**: Complex queries for reports, summaries, and analytics (e.g., sales trends over several years).
- **Normalization**: Denormalized (few large tables for faster read performance and easier querying).
- **Performance**: Optimized for fast query processing over large datasets.
- **Users**: Analysts, business managers, and decision-makers.
- **Example**: Data warehouses, reporting systems, financial analysis.
