# Composite Key in MySQL  
  
A composite key in MySQL is a key that consists of two or more columns, used together to uniquely identify each row in a table. Unlike a single-column primary key, a composite key combines multiple columns to create a unique identifier for records. This is particularly useful when a single column is not sufficient to ensure uniqueness.  
  
#### Characteristics  
  
- **Combines Columns**: Consists of two or more columns in a table.  
- **Uniqueness**: Ensures that combinations of values across the composite key columns are unique.  
- **Multiple Columns**: Can include any number of columns necessary to establish uniqueness.  
- **Primary Key or Unique Constraint**: Can serve as either a primary key or a unique constraint.  
  
#### Purpose  
  
- **Uniqueness**: Provides a way to ensure uniqueness when a single column is not sufficient.  
- **Relationship Establishment**: Facilitates establishing relationships between tables when multiple columns are involved.  
- **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Supports efficient querying and data retrieval based on the composite key columns.  
  
#### Creating a Composite Key  
  
To create a composite key in MySQL, you specify multiple columns when defining the primary key or a unique constraint for a table. For example:  
  
```sql  
CREATE TABLE enrollments (  
    student_id INT,  
    course_id INT,  
    enrollment_date DATE,  
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)  
);  
```  
  
This statement creates an `enrollments` table with a composite primary key consisting of the `student_id` and `course_id` columns. Together, these columns uniquely identify each enrollment record in the table.  
  
>[!Caution]  
>  
When using composite keys, consider the trade-offs in terms of query complexity and maintenance overhead. While they provide flexibility in ensuring uniqueness, they may also complicate query conditions and increase the complexity of database design.  
  
### Summary  
  
A composite key in MySQL combines multiple columns to create a unique identifier for records in a table. It is useful when a single column is not sufficient to ensure uniqueness and provides flexibility in database design. However, careful consideration should be given to the complexity and maintenance implications of using composite keys.
